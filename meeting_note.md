2/17 Meet with Maria. TODOs for next week:

- [x] clarify unknown formulas and algorithms in the [paper](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772700)
    - central differenct filter: use convolution to calculate derivative (velocity).
    - max amplitude = 35: human eyes' movement to oneside is about 30-35 degs max.
    - fine grid search: basically a grid search that explore all posibility and find the parameteres that produce optimal result.
    - saccade direction: not explicitly mentioned in the [paper](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2772700), but it's one dimentional, either horizontal or vertical.
    - [ ] TODO: smooth pursuit eye movement
    - [ ] TODO: Anti saccades
- [ ] format [source code](https://eeweb.engineering.nyu.edu/iselesni/eye-movement/): add comments, remove unused codes, ...
